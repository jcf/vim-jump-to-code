INTRODUCTION                                    *jump_to_code*

This plugin is designed to help you get to one of your many projects in your
preferred code directory.

You can use |:find| to jump to files and open directories, but this plugin is
designed to help you |:cd| in to the directory quickly instead of open it with
your favourite directory/file browser.

By default we search for directories in `$HOME/Code`, but this is configurable
via |g:jump_to_code_base|.

COMMANDS                                        *jump_to_code-commands*

The |:JumpToCode| command will autocomplete directories in your base directory.

                                                *jump_to_code-:JumpToCode*
:JumpToCode [directory]          Invoke |:cd| or |:lcd| to switch to `directory`.
